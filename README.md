# Blind Bot

**Transform a human into a robot!** Blind Bot is a creative and interactive game where teamwork, communication, and imagination come to life. This app lets you and your friends create and control "robots" in fun and unexpected ways.

Blind Bot is a tool to remote control a human. One person operates the controller, while the other becomes the robot. Using control buttons, the operator sends **voice commands** that the robot must follow, fostering trust, collaboration, and fun.

## üéÆ Game Overview
